### Each web page is built by HTML, CSS, JavaScript
# HTML are the elements of the web application
# CSS is the design of the web application
# Javascript is the functionallity of the web application

# each of those can be external or embedded in the HTML

# Selenium webdriver is a webdriver used for testing and supports all browsers and all OS's, basically speaks with the browser

# Locators are used to find an element on the web application (some examples can be found in webtest_Class_4.py in the same project)
